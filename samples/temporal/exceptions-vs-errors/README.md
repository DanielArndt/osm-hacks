# Exceptions vs Errors

This is a set of examples in an unknown state. They are used for testing and may not represent any reasonable working state.

They require a temporal server to be running.

You can run the server via docker using this repository:

https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose

For convenience, the quick start instructions are copied here. Assuming you
have docker and docker compose installed, you can run the following commands to
start the server:

    git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
    cd docker-compose
    docker compose up
